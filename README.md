# Wrapper
This is a wrapper around the nation rail [darwin feed](https://www.nationalrail.co.uk/developers/darwin-data-feeds). It was used to get large amounts of data from the national rail historic train api. This was to try and use machine learning to predict how delayed my moring train would be. The code in this repo was deployed to many vms to try and get over the rate limiting that was per ip.
